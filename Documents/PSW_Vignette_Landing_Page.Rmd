# Analysis Summary

Enrollment changes and other factors may lead to samples with substantially different compositions. Propensity score weighting is a potential mechanism for making samples more comparable on selected covariates. The vignettes below provide high-level overviews of propensity score weighting for cross-sectional studies, including example code for applying propensity score weighting to educational assessment data for simple mean difference analyses.
