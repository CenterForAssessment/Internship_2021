# June 4th Internship Update

Three weeks into the summer internship and there is already plenty to report!

* Continually learning the tools of the trade with student growth percentile (SGP) analyses, R package development, and the GitHub workflow.
* Summarized results from a simulation examining the efficacy of multiple imputation methods for missing assessment and growth data. 
* With generous help, set up [this GitHub based website](https://centerforassessment.github.io/Internship_2021/index.html) to share results.
* Presentation slides for the first internship update can be found [here](https://centerforassessment.github.io/Internship_2021/articles/Internship_Presentation_Landing_Page.html).
