# Introduction

Welcome to [Allie Cooperman's](https://github.com/alliecooperman) Github repo for the 2021 summer internship with the
[Center for Assessment](https://www.nciea.org)! I am extremely excited to be working this summer with [Damian Betebenner](https://github.com/dbetebenner) and [Adam Van Iwaarden](https://github.com/adamvi). This repo contains my internship work, including summary vignettes, analysis source code, and presentations that I made as part of my internship at the Center.

# My Background

I'm a Psychology PhD student at the [University of Minnesota - Twin Cities (UMN)](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/), specializing in [Quantitative and Psychometric Methods](https://cla.umn.edu/psychology/graduate/areas-specialization/quantitativepsychometric-methods-qpm).
My research at UMN broadly encompasses latent variable modeling (e.g., factor analysis, item response theory), test bias, and longitudinal measurement.
I'm particularly interested in the intersections of research and education policy, with a focus on using advanced quantitative methods to
better understand children's educational achievement.

# Project Overview

My work this summer includes:

* Comparing the efficacy of multiple imputation methods for scale scores and student growth percentiles (SGPs) when data are missing.
* Exploring the applicability of propensity score weighting for comparing scale scores and SGPs across years. 
* Creating open-source reporting tools to evaluate academic growth.
