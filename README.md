Center for Assessment Internship 2021
=====================================

Welcome to [Allie Cooperman's](https://github.com/alliecooperman) Github repo for the 2021 summer internship with the
[Center for Assessment](https://www.nciea.org)! This repo contains my work for the summer, including articles on the work I did during the
internship, source code associated with the analyses I performed as well as a collection of presentations I made as part of my internship at the Center.

## My Background

I'm a Psychology PhD student at the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities (UMN), specializing in Quantitative and Psychometric Methods.
My research at UMN broadly encompasses latent variable modeling (e.g., factor analysis, item response theory), test bias, and longitudinal measurement.
I'm particularly interested in the intersections of research and education policy, with a focus on using advanced quantitative methods to
better understand children's educational achievement.
